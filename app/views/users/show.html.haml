%h2 Interest in Amazon Gift Card
%p Upon successful completion of any of the above experiments, you are eligible for a $5 Amazon.com gift card. The first 20 people to satisfactorily* complete the survey will receive a short email questionnaire shortly after completion.

%p I will do my best to notify you via this page when 20 surveys have been completed.
%p You can also opt out of the gift card. If you do, it means that one additional person will be able to contribute to this study, and I will be doubleplusgrateful.
